# The Black Scholes Merton Calculator
This project launches a nice little web application that allows users to calculate European option prices using the Black Scholes Merton Differential Equation. This repository has the entire full stack encapsulated within it, with each part of the stack divided amongst the two directories **/client** and **/server**.

## Instructions for setting up the web application locally can be found in the README in the `/server` and `/client` directories


This application is still in continuous development as it's intended to display my growth in application development as well as financial engineering. As such, any thoughts, suggestions, and issues are always appreciated.

This application will be a component of a larger set of financial engineering and machine learning tools I'm in the works of developing.
